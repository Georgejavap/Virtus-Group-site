## UX & Design Rationale

The design follows current UX standards:

- **Information hierarchy**: Clear section headers, content groupings, and navigation structure
- **User control**: No audio autoplay, modals can be exited easily, login validation
- **Consistency**: Repeated structure in widgets, color use, button feedback
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, alt text on images, responsive design, muted media
- **Confirmation**: Modals, protected login feedback, interaction highlights

Design decisions were made with real gym users in mind—supporting clarity, engagement, and trust.

## 🎨 Project Display Note

While developing this project, my goal was to create a polished and fully responsive events section, with smooth full-screen overlays, centered content, and clean layout transitions — as shown in my development environment screenshots.

However, due to limitations with GitHub Pages and how it handles rendering and styling updates (particularly with some CSS rules and layout behaviors), I wasn't fully able to replicate the final look as seen locally. Some elements, such as the expanded event widget overlays and centered text alignment, did not render exactly as expected once deployed.

Despite multiple commits and refinement attempts, the live version on GitHub Pages fell slightly short of the intended finish. This project still demonstrates the key functionality and design direction I was working toward, and the screenshots included represent the more accurate, polished version I achieved in my local environment.

> ⚠️ _Note: If certain layouts appear slightly off on GitHub Pages, please refer to the provided screenshots for the original intended design._

## Future Plans

- Integrate real-time booking APIs
- Connect Typeform consultation form for dynamic entry
- Enhance member portal with OAuth-based login
- Add backend CMS for blog & events updates
